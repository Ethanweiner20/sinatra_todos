# Problem: Sorting Lists

# PROBLEM

_Explicit Requirements_:

- **Input**: An array of `lists`
- Order lists such that incomplete lists appear before complete lists
- Yield the list, and its associated index, to the block
- **Note**: The index is the session-defined index, not the updated index caused by sorting

_Questions_:

_Initial Ideas and Mental Models_:

- Need a way to preserve the index of each list before/after
- Convert -> hash w/ indices
- Partition hash
- Iterate over each hash + yield
